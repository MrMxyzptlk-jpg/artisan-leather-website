# Leather Goods Catalog Website

A responsive static website built for a local leather artisan to showcase handmade handbags, purses, and fanny packs.  
The goal of this project is to provide a clean, fast, and accessible online catalog while serving as a real-world freelance portfolio piece.

## Project Overview

This website was designed as a simple and effective digital presence for a small leather goods venture.  
It focuses on product presentation, performance, and ease of use rather than complex e-commerce features.

The site includes:
- A home page with brand introduction
- A product catalog with images and prices
- Informational pages about the artisan and the crafting process
- Contact information for direct inquiries

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 (semantic markup)
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (minimal, progressive enhancement)
- WebP images for optimized performance
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Design Principles
